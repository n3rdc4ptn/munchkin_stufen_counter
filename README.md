# Munchkin Stufen Counter

This small project is a counter for the game Munchkin. Is is a small Svelte App which can be installed as a PWA.
It supports multiple players and saves the current state in the local storage.

You can also link up devices to have a shared counter. The changes are synced via WebRTC. So no server is needed.

The app is available at https://munchkin-stufen-counter.pages.dev/.
